# PS2 Games Knowledge Graph Visualization Guide

## Overview
This guide provides multiple methods to visualize the PS2 games knowledge graph generated by your Apache Jena application.

## Method 1: Interactive Web Visualization (Recommended)

### Steps:
1. **Run your Java application** to generate the `ps2_games_database.ttl` file
2. **Open the HTML file** in your web browser:
   - Navigate to: `c:\Users\anees\jena-demo\visualize.html`
   - Double-click to open in your default browser
   - Or drag and drop it into any modern web browser

### Features:
- Interactive network diagram
- Color-coded node types (Games, Developers, Characters, etc.)
- Hover tooltips with additional information
- Drag and zoom functionality
- Export to PNG image capability
- Statistics dashboard

### Screenshot locations:
- Use the "Export Image" button in the web interface
- Or take a screenshot of the browser window

## Method 2: Python-based Network Visualization

### Prerequisites:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Steps:
1. **Install Python dependencies**:
   ```bash
   cd c:\Users\anees\jena-demo
   pip install matplotlib networkx numpy rdflib sparqlwrapper
   ```

2. **Run the Python visualization script**:
   ```bash
   python visualize_graph.py
   ```

### Output:
- `ps2_games_network.png` - Main network diagram
- `ps2_games_network.pdf` - PDF version
- `ps2_games_statistics.png` - Statistics charts
- `ps2_games_statistics.pdf` - PDF version of statistics

## Method 3: GraphViz DOT Format

### Steps:
1. **Compile and run the GraphViz exporter**:
   ```bash
   cd c:\Users\anees\jena-demo
   mvn compile exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="org.example.GraphVizExporter"
   ```

2. **Generate PNG from DOT file**:
   - **Option A**: Install GraphViz locally
     ```bash
     dot -Tpng ps2_games_graph.dot -o ps2_games_graph.png
     ```
   
   - **Option B**: Use online GraphViz tools
     - Go to: https://dreampuf.github.io/GraphvizOnline/
     - Copy the contents of `ps2_games_graph.dot`
     - Paste into the online editor
     - Download the generated image

## Method 4: Professional RDF Visualization Tools

### Option A: Protégé (Free)
1. Download from: https://protege.stanford.edu/
2. File → Open → Select `ps2_games_database.ttl`
3. View → Show → OntoGraf tab
4. Configure layout and export as image

### Option B: yEd (Free)
1. Download from: https://www.yworks.com/products/yed
2. Import the GraphViz DOT file
3. Apply automatic layouts
4. Export as PNG/PDF

### Option C: Gephi (Free)
1. Download from: https://gephi.org/
2. Convert TTL to GEXF format (online converters available)
3. Import and apply layouts
4. Export high-resolution images

## Method 5: Online RDF Visualizers

### Option A: RDF Grapher
- URL: http://www.rdfgrapher.com/
- Upload your `ps2_games_database.ttl` file
- Generate and download visualization

### Option B: LOD Live
- URL: http://en.lodlive.it/
- Paste your RDF data
- Explore interactive visualization

## Recommended Workflow for Screenshots

1. **Start with the HTML visualization** (`visualize.html`)
   - Open in Chrome/Firefox for best results
   - Use full-screen mode (F11)
   - Take high-resolution screenshots
   - Use the built-in "Export Image" function

2. **Use Python script for publication-quality images**
   - Generates vector-based PDF files
   - Customizable colors and layouts
   - Professional-looking statistics charts

3. **Use GraphViz for complex layouts**
   - Best for hierarchical representations
   - Multiple output formats available
   - Highly customizable styling

## Tips for Better Visualizations

1. **Colors**: Each node type has a distinct color
   - Games: Red (#FF6B6B)
   - Developers: Teal (#4ECDC4)
   - Characters: Blue (#45B7D1)
   - Series: Green (#96CEB4)
   - Genres: Yellow (#FFEAA7)
   - Awards: Purple (#DDA0DD)

2. **Layout**: 
   - Use physics-based layouts for organic appearance
   - Try hierarchical layouts for clear relationships
   - Group related nodes together

3. **Labels**: 
   - Keep labels concise
   - Use tooltips for additional information
   - Consider abbreviating long names

4. **Export Quality**:
   - Use PNG for web/presentations
   - Use PDF/SVG for print materials
   - Set DPI to 300+ for high-quality prints

## Troubleshooting

**If the HTML file doesn't work:**
- Ensure you have an internet connection (for vis.js library)
- Try a different browser
- Check browser console for errors

**If Python visualization fails:**
- Make sure all dependencies are installed
- Check Python version (3.7+ recommended)
- Verify matplotlib backend is properly configured

**If GraphViz export fails:**
- Ensure the TTL file exists and is valid
- Check file permissions
- Verify the Java classpath includes all Jena libraries

## Sample Output Description

The visualization should show:
- **6 game nodes** (red circles) representing PS2 games
- **5 developer nodes** (teal circles) representing game studios
- **6 character nodes** (blue circles) representing game characters
- **4 series nodes** (green circles) representing game franchises
- **3 genre nodes** (yellow circles) representing game types
- **2 award nodes** (purple circles) representing awards
- **Connecting edges** showing relationships between entities

The network should clearly show patterns like:
- Japanese developers dominating the dataset
- Action games being the most common genre
- Character-to-game relationships
- Series groupings
- Award distributions
